# WBY-Script-Transfer
Small script I made to automate the transfer of a comic book script from a word document to a columned format of dialogue only.

Worked for the specific format of the script I was working with which indicated the Page, issue, etc that each snippet of dialogue belonged in.

For intellectual property rights reasons I cannot post the script unfortunately.
